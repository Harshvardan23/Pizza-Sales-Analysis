# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

üìå Project Overview
Pizza is undeniably one of the most beloved meals across the globe, with its rich variety of flavors and styles. As I embarked on this data analysis project, the first thing that came to mind was to explore the patterns and trends in pizza sales. Pizza, Italy's famous tasty and affordable meal, has a way of drawing people in, and it was no surprise that I chose this topic when searching for a dataset to analyze.

In this project, the goal was to dive deep into pizza sales data to uncover meaningful insights, identify key trends, and make actionable recommendations. Data analysis is more than just creating beautiful dashboards; it‚Äôs about understanding the data, finding meaningful patterns, and drawing conclusions that can drive decisions.

Through the use of SQL and Excel, I was able to clean, analyze, and visualize the data in a way that helps answer important business questions like which pizza category is most popular, what time of day sales peak, and what factors drive sales. The project goes beyond just visualization ‚Äì it digs into the why behind the data to create a narrative that can help businesses optimize their strategies.
